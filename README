Sijax stands for "Simple ajax" and provides just that.
It's a simple php/jquery library providing easy ajax integration for php web apps.

Sijax is very similar to Xajax ( http://xajaxproject.org/ ), which was developed way before it.
The difference is that Sijax aims to be a lot simpler and faster,
while still providing the majority of features and extensibility.

There are sample files in `Sijax/examples` that demonstrate how it can be used.
